# cipher
Cipher with key where we encrypt text by changing each letter on its adjacent letter from key. 
Key has to have even number of letters and none letter can repeat itself.
For exemple: 
with key "cipher", we can divide it on pairs to see better what it is about - "ci-ph-er". 
When input text contains "c" it should be encrypted to "i", if input text contains "i" it should be encrypted to "c" and it works the same with every pair in the key.
